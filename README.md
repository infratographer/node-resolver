# Node Resolver

Node resolver provides a GraphQL query of `node (id: ID!)` that allows you to resolve the type of any graphql object that uses a prefixedID.

Node resolver needs a schema.graphql file on startup to parse the schema, this should be generated by api-gateway during the supergraph generation so that all objects that implement interfaces in your graph are in the schema.
